###### Week of March 2nd, 2020 - March 8th, 2020 

Chronicle your activities related to the project on which you are going to work. What have you done to install the development environment? What issues are you considering? How are you filtering them? What else are you reading? In general, write about everything you are doing relevant to your project.
Continue to chronicle your activities related to the project on which you are now working, in detail. Treat the blog as its name's derivation implies (it derives from web log), a journal written on-line, like a ship's log. What have you done to install the development environment? What issues are you considering? There should be dates, times, links to relevant files and web pages etc.

This week, my team: [Daniel](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/dmallia17-weekly/), [Boubacar](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/boubascript-weekly/), and I agreed to contribute as a team to [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master) after several days of *incredible* pondering. 

On **Monday, March 2nd**, my team and I were given almost the entire class period to decide on an open source project to work on. Daniel took the initiative to make a document where we listed out all the possible projects there were for us to work on, and we each took turns crossing out certain projects off of that list based off of personal preference, community activity, meaningful discussion, its appeal, amount of doable issues, and other factors.



**Other Activity**: 
- Added my [favorite local Japanese restaurant](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81947039) to OpenStreetMap.
- Opened a pull request for fixing typos on Daniel's blog. 
- Went to a tech meetup recently and found out about an open source phone made by Purism, called [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/). The concept is fascinating.
