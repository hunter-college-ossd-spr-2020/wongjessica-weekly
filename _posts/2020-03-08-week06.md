###### Week of March 2nd, 2020 - March 8th, 2020 

Chronicle your activities related to the project on which you are going to work. What have you done to install the development environment? What issues are you considering? How are you filtering them? What else are you reading? In general, write about everything you are doing relevant to your project.
Continue to chronicle your activities related to the project on which you are now working, in detail. Treat the blog as its name's derivation implies (it derives from web log), a journal written on-line, like a ship's log. What have you done to install the development environment? What issues are you considering? There should be dates, times, links to relevant files and web pages etc.
