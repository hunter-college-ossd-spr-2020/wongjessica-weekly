###### Week of February 17th, 2020 - February 23rd, 2020 
As I already mentioned in my previous blogs, I have been actively searching for open source contributions this entire time, some of which you can find on this list. I have also added some more projects I've considered. Here, I will sort these projects by which seem the most appealing for me to work on.

**Projects I've looked at**
- [The Top 19 Tetris Open Source Projects](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/tetris), more specifically:
    - [tetris - A terminal interface for Tetris](https://github.com/samtay/tetris)
    - [Flatris](https://github.com/skidding/flatris)
- [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components), Google's UI/UX open source code components, more specifically:
    - [material-components-web-react](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-react)
    - [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
    - [material-components-ios](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios)
- [TEAMMATES](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates)
    - The project website for the TEAMMATES feedback management tool for education.
- [DuckDuckGo Privacy Extension](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension)
    - DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials browser extension for Firefox, Chrome, Safari.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)

**Projects I've eliminated**
- [tetris - A terminal interface for Tetris](https://github.com/samtay/tetris) 
    - Very inactive GitHub repository, last update was 7 months ago. Also has 0 issues, 0 pull requests, and 3 contributors.
- [material-components-ios](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios)
    - Although I do want to start learning Objective-C/Swift, I think contributing here is out of my scope for now. I will definitely look back into this repository by the end of the semester, but, as of now, I will put this project on hold.

**Projects that are candidates**
- [TEAMMATES](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates)
    - As I'm typing this, their last update was 24 minutes ago, so definitely a very active community. Their README and CONTRIBUTING file make me feel like I'm being welcomed to contribute. Also, there are 200+ issues, that I can see myself working on.  
- [DuckDuckGo Privacy Extension](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension)
    - Based off of the contributing document, they are mainly looking for bug reports/feature requests. As a former software engineer/quality assurance intern at a start-up, it excited me to find new bugs as well as introduce new features. I would love to contribute the same way for DuckDuckGo.

**Projects that look promising**
- [material-components-web-react](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-react)
- [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
    - I think the above two repositories are promising because they focus on something I'm passionate about: web development. Also, both of these repositories have 100+ issues. I've browsed through some issues and some of them seem doable for somebody of my skillset.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)
    - I know people that have become great programmers due to this website. I have always considered learning new programming languages from here, and I also have read a lot of the articles they provide. Their GitHub repository is very active, and the community seems very welcoming. There are 3,999 contributors, so I'd be honored to be one of the newest ones!

I also created a pull request for [Keisuke's blog, ](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/Ks5810-weekly) fixing his grammar/typos to make his Week #1 blog sound better! I am excited to create more pull requests for my peers' blogs, because I am getting the hang of the process.
