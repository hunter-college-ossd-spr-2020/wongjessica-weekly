###### Week of March 9th, 2020 - March 15th, 2020 

[ âœ“ ] **Installing Atom's Development Environment** 
-  I left off last week with an unfinished Atom developer environment due to my main blocker being that I could not open the Atom environment on my laptop. Luckily, last Monday, Daniel was able to help me by showing me exactly how he got the developer environment set up on his laptop, sending me via iMessage the exact command I had to execute. I really admire Daniel's intelligence, and I am really glad that I am working with him on this project. Last time, I got an error that "Atom" couldn't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software. I searched this issue through GitHub and was able to smoothly fix it by right-clicking on the Application in the directory and manually opening the software from there. That seemed to fix the issue. I would guess that it's similar to Windows, when you have to force an application to run as administrator. Then, I followed [this](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/19) GitHub issue in order to get the atom shell command to work, and, finally, I ran this command and got the [development environment](https://i.imgur.com/CgqfTs2.png) to run! (Yay!)
[] **Searching for issues within Atom**
- Daniel, Boubacar and I all got together on Saturday, March 14th (Happy Pi Day!) and got into a video call that lasted around 2 hours. 

[ ] **Other priorities to be determined**

**Other Activity**: 
- I read up on [this](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9) article titled "Open Source is Not About You".
