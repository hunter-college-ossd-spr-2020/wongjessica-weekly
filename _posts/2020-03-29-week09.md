###### Week of March 23rd, 2020 - March 29th, 2020 

Day 7 in full isolation. I haven't trekked outside since. I wonder how the outside world is like now. I'd imagine darkness, fire everywhere, buildings destroyed, citizens running around and screaming. The line that my professor Stewart Weiss ended off with in the lecture last week said verbatim: "It's a different world now. Just try to work with it." 

Anywho, let me talk about some different things. My experience in contributing to Wikipedia, Kevin Fleming's Talk, and my FOSS Project Progress.

## Wikipedia Contributing

- I made two contributions to Wikipedia this week and I feel GREAT, I feel so impactful. (I just hope my contributions don't get reverted)

## Kevin Fleming's Talk

- Wow, I don't know how to put into words how excited I feel right now. That lecture was empowering in so many ways. In one way, I am very impressed with how knowledgeable and well-spoken Fleming was. In general, I really admire people who are very well informed in a subject that they are passionate about, That's why Fleming's lecture hit me really hard, because one day I aspire to be just like that. I want to be an expert in something I am passionate about and be able to pass on that knowledge to others. Right now, I'm eyeballing a specialization in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or Big Data, but I still have time to decide what's truly right for me.
- Not only was Fleming's passion inspiring, but the new technologies I have learned were fascinating. More specifically, I enjoyed hearing him talk about [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano), [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [Kuberbetes](https://kubernetes.io/). I was even more electrified after the presentation because there are so many new technologies to search and look into. I have a passion to learn so many new things, but what gets to me is when I realize there's just so much that I'll never know. Boubacar and I were talking about this topic, and he said something really amazing: "It's okay though, because we can learn enough about what matters."

## FOSS Project Progress

[ ] **Installing Atom's Development Environment** 

[ ] **Searching for issues within Atom**

[ ] **Other priorities to be determined**

**Other Activity**: 
- I read [Why to Report Bugs](https://pointersgonewild.com/2019/11/02/they-might-never-tell-you-its-broken/).
- Submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/sdhani-weekly/pull/4) for two typos on Shania's [Week 9 Blog](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/sdhani-weekly/week09/).
