###### Week of March 23rd, 2020 - March 29th, 2020 

Day 7 in full isolation. I don't even think this is worth keeping track of, at this point. I haven't trekked outside since. I wonder how the outside world is like now. I'd imagine darkness, fire everywhere, buildings destroyed, citizens running around and screaming. The line that my professor Stewart Weiss ended off with in the lecture last week said verbatim: "It's a different world now. Just try to work with it." 

Anywho, let me talk about some different things.

## Wikipedia Contributing

- I made two contributions to Wikipedia this week and I feel GREAT, I feel so impactful. (I just hope my contributions don't get reverted)

## Kevin Fleming's Talk

- Wow, I don't know how to put into words how excited I feel right now. That lecture was empowering in so many ways.
