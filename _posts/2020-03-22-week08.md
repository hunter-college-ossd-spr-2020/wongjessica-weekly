## How COVID-19 is Affecting Me

- On March 11th, 2020, the New York City government announced that CUNY classes will be taking a week-long break, and that after that, classes will become remote. Well, it has been 11 days since then and it is apparent that nothing will ever be the same again. From the time I am typing this right now, there are over 10,000 confirmed cases in New York City, who knows, the more accurate count could easily be double or even triple this number. It truly is a frightening world to live in right now. I haven't left my house in days. To be honest, I was really upset when I heard that classes would be canceling. I really enjoyed the social interaction I have had at school, and I felt like this semester was my most social semester of college. I was in a really bad place last semester, and so I worked really hard to get back up this semester. It really sucks that this pandemic stripped me of my social life. I am trying my best to maintain all of my friendships online via social media such as Facebook and Discord. 
- My mother lost her job today, and even before she lost her job, her hours got cut down a lot. She is the manager of a restaurant, and the restaurant was already doing poorly prior to this epidemic. She has been working at this restaurant for the last 12 years, and it breaks my heart seeing her work for minimum wage every single day, exhausting herself. We are definitely struggling financially right now, but I am grateful that we have at least some money saved up. I am sort of glad that my mother does not have to exhaust herself so much anymore, and that she can finally rest. She begged me today to help her file for unemployment. I hope that I can graduate next year and find a well paying full-time software engineering position so that my mother does not have to work so hard anymore. 
- Sorry, that was really personal, but I just wanted to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading!

## FOSS Project Progress

[ ] **Installing Atom's Development Environment** 

- As you might have noticed, this point is no longer checked (as it was last week). Well, this is because on Saturday, March 21st, Boubacar, Daniel and I hopped onto a 2.5 hour long video call and came to a huge revelation. We all had a collective misunderstanding from the very beginning, and this comes from a big flaw in [Atom's flight manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/hacking-on-atom-core/). 

[ ] **Searching for issues within Atom**

[ ] **Other priorities to be determined**

**Other Activity**: 
- I am currently still researching on which Wikipedia pages to contribute to, and I will come back and update this section once I finish my contributions.
