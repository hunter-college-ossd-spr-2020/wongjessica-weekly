###### Week of March 16th, 2020 - March 22nd, 2020

- On March 11th, 2020, the NYC government announced that CUNY classes will be taking a week-long break, and that after that, classes will become remote.

- As you might have noticed, this point is no longer checked (as it was last week). Well, this is because on Saturday, March 21st, Boubacar, Daniel and I hopped onto a 2.5 hour long video call and came to a huge revelation. We all had a collective misunderstanding from the very beginning, and this comes from a big flaw in [Atom's flight manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/hacking-on-atom-core/). 

[ ] **Searching for issues within Atom**

[ ] **Other priorities to be determined**

**Other Activity**:
