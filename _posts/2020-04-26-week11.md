## Vicky Brasseur's Talk
- Prior to Vicky Brasseur's talk, I did my fair share of research on her. I looked through her website and read through her "About" page and her resume. My first impression of her is that her work is extremely impressive. I then stumbled upon the presentations section of her website and started listening to one of them titled "The real costs of Open Source Sustainability". Her voice instantly soothed my ears. I was astonished at how much her voice pulled me into her presentation, it felt so calming to listen to, and it made the points she brought up so intriguing. Her passion for open source is admirable, and it made me look forward to her talk even more.
