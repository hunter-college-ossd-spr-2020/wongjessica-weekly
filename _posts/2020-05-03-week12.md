**Other Activity**: 

- My open source professor gave the class an interesting question: "**Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software?**". Well, I first want to preface by saying that I do not want to be overly picky, and that I would definitely work at almost any company willing to see my talents and hire me as a software engineer. I would just love to get a full-time job offer after graduation. Prior to taking my open source software development course if someone asked me for my preference in companies (if I had a choice), I would have immediately responded with a top tech company, such as Google, Microsoft, or Facebook, without hesitation. However, based off of the talks from Vicky Brasseur, Gil Yehuda, and Kevin Fleming, based off of my reading of [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html), and based off of my own research, my vision for the companies I'd like to work for in the near future has changed. I think the concept of open source software is extremely cool, and I have come across a lot of genuinely kind communities. I also think it's cool how open source technologies are a lot more customer-focused as opposed to proprietary software, and I love the idea that somebody who doesn't work at my company can still help me fix my code. Seeing the success of Red Hat is also quite inspiring. So now, if somebody asked me for my preference in companies, if I had a choice, it would still be a top tech company, but I would definitely open my horizons and keep a leek out for open source software focused companies.
