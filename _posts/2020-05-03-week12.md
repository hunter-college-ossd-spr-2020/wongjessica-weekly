###### Week of April 27th, 2020 - May 3rd, 2020 

For me personally. this week has been a bit more productive than the rest. Ever since the lockdown, motivation was something I had to force out of myself. Gradually, I have started to get a little more dedicated towards my passions, especially with all things tech. I hope this motivation of mine will be here to stay.

## [Business Models for Open Source](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html)

- Gil Yehuda and Vicky Brasseur also touched on business models for open source,

## FOSS Project Progress

[ ✓ ] **Installed Atom's Development Environment** 

[ ✓ ] **Searched for issues within Atom**

~~**Work on our issue**~~

[ ✓ ] **Find a new project**

- As stated in Week 11's blogpost, Daniel, Boubacar and I chose to work on OpenCV for our new open source project. However, that decision wasn't made for sure until this weekend. This is because we were still tentatively throwing out other project ideas, such as Pandas and Python-DS. We even went so far as to even consider the more "giant" projects, like Python and Vim. 

[ ✓ ] **Find possible issues**

- My team and I had a couple of video chats this weekend to discuss further action regarding our open source project. 


**Other Activity**: 

- My open source professor gave the class an interesting question: "**Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software?**". Well, I first want to preface by saying that I do not want to be overly picky, and that I would definitely work at almost any company willing to see my talents and hire me as a software engineer. I would just love to get a full-time job offer after graduation. Prior to taking my open source software development course if someone asked me for my preference in companies (if I had a choice), I would have immediately responded with a top tech company, such as Google, Microsoft, or Facebook, without hesitation. However, based off of the talks from Vicky Brasseur, Gil Yehuda, and Kevin Fleming, based off of my reading of [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html), and based off of my own research, my vision for the companies I'd like to work for in the near future has changed. I think the concept of open source software is extremely cool, and I have come across a lot of genuinely kind communities. I also think it's cool how open source technologies are a lot more customer-focused as opposed to proprietary software, and I love the idea that somebody who doesn't work at my company can still help me fix my code. Seeing the success of Red Hat is also quite inspiring. So now, if somebody asked me for my preference in companies, if I had a choice, it would still be a top tech company, but I would definitely open my horizons and keep a leek out for open source software focused companies.
