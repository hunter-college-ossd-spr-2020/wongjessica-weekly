[ WIP ] **Get OpenCV Installed and Running**

- I used OpenCV's [MacOS Installation Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/db2/tutorial_macos_install.html) written by my fellow peer Sajarin Dider.

[ ✓ ] **Opened some issues**

- My team and I opened multiple issues/pull requests within this last week. All of these issues were a team effort. Last Sunday we opened our [first OpenCV issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/17212) where we noticed that in one of their tutorial pages, there were a couple of broken links. I was astonished by the prompt response time and the helpfulness of the man that responded to us. He thanked us for the feedback and told us that we were free to submit a PR. He even went onto tell us to merge to branch 3.4, because that's their default branch for bug fixes and documentation fixes. It made me feel a lot more motivated. I immediately thought to myself "*Wow, we're already off to a better start than Atom*". Daniel opened up a [pull request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/17218) on Monday fixing those broken links. 

- We opened up another [new issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/17220) on Monday,  where we addressed that some terminal command instructions on their "[How to Contribute wiki](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute#the-instruction-in-brief)" did not work. We then went onto suggest a fix, so that the commands would work. Unfortunately, since it's a Wiki page, we can't submit a pull request to directly fix the change. However, we are still helping, and that is enough.

- We opened up another quick [pull request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/17219) fixing a broken link on their "How to contribute" guide.


[ WIP ] **Work on more issues**
