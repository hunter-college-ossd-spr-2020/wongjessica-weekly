###### Week of May 4th, 2020 - May 10th, 2020 

Wow, this was an extremely productive week. My team and I have gotten a lot more done this week, than towards Atom as a whole.

## FOSS Project Progress

[ ✓ ] **Installed Atom's Development Environment** 

[ ✓ ] **Searched for issues within Atom**

~~**Work on our issue**~~

[ ✓ ] **Find a new project**

[ ✓ ] **Find possible issues**

[ ✓ ] **Get OpenCV Set up so I can start making contributions**

- I followed OpenCV's [MacOS Installation Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/db2/tutorial_macos_install.html) written by my fellow peer Sajarin Dider. I also followed their [guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d4/db1/tutorial_documentation.html) for writing documentation for OpenCV. I installed Python3, NumPy, CMake, and [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/). Doxygen is the tool OpenCV uses to generate the documentation on their website using source code. I ended up asking Daniel and Boubacar for a little assistance on how to go about installing Doxygen, because I was confused on whether or not to download Doxygen using Homebrew, or to just use the dmg download link. I ended up doing both, just to be safe. Other than that, I did not run into any problems.

[ ✓ ] **OpenCV Issues**

- My team and I opened multiple issues/pull requests within this last week. All of these issues were a team effort. Last Sunday we opened our [first OpenCV issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/17212) where we noticed that in one of their tutorial pages, there were a couple of broken links. I was astonished by the prompt response time and the helpfulness of the man that responded to us. He thanked us for the feedback and told us that we were free to submit a PR. He even went onto tell us to merge to branch 3.4, because that's their default branch for bug fixes and documentation fixes. It made me feel a lot more motivated. I immediately thought to myself "*Wow, we're already off to a better start than Atom*". Daniel opened up a [pull request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/17218) on Monday fixing those broken links. 

- We opened up another [new issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/17220) on Monday,  where we addressed that some terminal command instructions on their "[How to Contribute wiki](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute#the-instruction-in-brief)" did not work. We then went onto suggest a fix, so that the commands would work. Unfortunately, since it's a Wiki page, we can't submit a pull request to directly fix the change. However, we are still helping, and that is enough.

- We opened up another quick [pull request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/17219) fixing a broken link on their "How to contribute" guide.

- For our ***big*** project, we opened up an [issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/17245) that focuses on the consolidation of OpenCV's contour tutorials. We are currently waiting for maintainer/contributor feedback.
