###### Week of March 30th, 2020 - April 19th, 2020 

## FOSS Project Progress

[ ✓ ] **Installed Atom's Development Environment** 

[ ✓ ] **Searched for issues within Atom**
- I am currently basically finished with Atom's [flight manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/handling-uris/) and learned new interesting things.
- Currently still contributing to Daniel, Boubacar and I's collective collaborative [file](https://hackmd.io/C_2OEnduSSa5FlCZ7x1fUQ?both) in order to organize all of our progress, resources, and editing. We all got on a short 30-minute call to review what next steps we should take. We decided that we still wanted to work on Atom's flight manual and make edits to it because we think it will be beneficial to all new contributors to Atom in the future. Our plan was to ask our open-source professor for his thoughts on that and see where to go from there. **Update:** As of Monday, Daniel, Boubacar and I finished typing up our [Atom issue](https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io/issues/608) and we are currently awaiting maintainer approval to work on the issue. All three of us played rock-paper-scissors to decide who posts the issue. Boubacar won. For next week, we are planning to go about searching for coding contributions.

[ ] **Work on our issue (update next week)**
