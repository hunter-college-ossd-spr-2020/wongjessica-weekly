## Gil Yehuda's Talk

- Prior to listening to Gil Yehuda's talk, I did a little research on him. I perused his Linkedin and Quora profiles thoroughly and stumbled across [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/05/02/whats-the-craziest-thing-you-ever-said-at-a-job-interview-and-still-got-the-job/) Quora response that had the privilege of getting published on the official Forbes website. Mr. Yehuda discussed in this article how the company he was interviewing for did not have their shit together. This is because each interviewer had different perspectives on how the job was defined. As a result, he was seriously questioning whether or not he should work at a company that does not know what they are doing, and he addressed that exact concern with the recruiter. The recruiter knew and understood completely, and that is exactly why they needed Mr. Yehuda, because they needed somebody that could see issues that the others couldn't. My favorite quote from the article was in the last paragraph, when he wrote "I said "If you make me an offer I can't refuse, then I won't be able to refuse it." She came back 15 minutes later with an offer I could not, and did not refuse." At that moment, I looked back through the article a second time and realized a couple of things...

    - Mr. Yehuda is an excellent writer. As expected from somebody with over 1,000 answered questions on Quora, but wow. I am truly impressed with his word choice. From this, I assumed that he was going to be a very well-spoken speaker.

    - He is valuable in the tech industry. Why else would the company specifically need *him* to fix the problems within the company? Why else would he have been given the offer on the spot? Once I realized this, I knew right away that his talk was going to be *extremely* insightful and interesting to listen to.

- And those realizations proved true. I really enjoyed listening to Mr. Yehuda's talk because he was well-spoken, very knowledgable about open-source, and a fun guy! So it was very easy absorbing information from his lecture. It was fascinating hearing about the evolution of how companies viewed open-source software, and how he expressed the distinction of fear versus love in the open-source world. It was brilliant.

- I did not want to disrupt him in the middle of his talk to make remarks, so I left my questions until the very end. I had one typed into the chat, but I hesitated on pressing enter for the longest time out of anxiety. You're probably wondering, how could I be nervous in an online class? Well, I was mainly worried that my question would sound silly and my then peers would have internally judged me. I am not trying to say anything negative about my peers, I know that the chances of this happening are very low. This is 100% a personal problem of mine and I am actively trying my best to overcome my anxiety.

**Other Activity**: 
- I read [Folding@Home's Covid19 Activity](https://foldingathome.org/covid19/).

- I have started to binge-watch a classic anime series called Naruto. This show was the epitome of childhood amongst most of my friends, and I have definitely missed out on a lot. I only wish I watched Naruto a lot sooner because this anime is fantastic, and now I finally get to talk to my friends about it.

- I made three more contributions to Wikipedia which can be found [here](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/wongjessica-weekly/contributions/). Now that I have attained the minimum number of required Wikipedia contributions needed for my open-source class, I am finally relieved of the pressure to contribute something. Now I can focus on making more major contributions to Wikipedia that aren't just grammar edits and typo fixes.
